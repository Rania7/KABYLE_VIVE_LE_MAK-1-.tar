can you give me the main where we set the environment for NFV problem. we have to simulate the arriving query corresponding the poisson law. the query is the virtual network having nodes with needs in CPU AND RAM, and virtual link between this nodes with needs of bandwidth. the environment is the physical infrastructure  that represent a network with physical node that have their capacities in RAM and CPU, and physical links between the nodes that have their capacities of bandwidth. the goel is to place and chain the arriving virtual link on the physical infrastructure with maximizing the acceptance of th virtual link placed on physical and with minimizing the consumption of energy , with the update of infrastructure capacities after each placing of virtual network (query) on environment(infrastructure physical. can you give me the code of this main using gym biblio python. the agent , i already code it , it's ddpg algorithm.
